## Hi there 👋

Software Engineer & Data Engineer building SaaS, data systems, and AI-driven products.

Currently focused on:

## What I Do

I design and build end-to-end data and product systems:
from ingestion → transformation → analytics → product integration.

I’m especially interested in:
- Data infrastructure

- Product-driven engineering
- Automation at scale
