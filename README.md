## Hi there 👋

Software Engineer & Data Engineer building SaaS, data systems, and AI-driven products.

Currently focused on:
- Scalable data pipelines (Python, GCP, BigQuery)
- SaaS products & Chrome Extensions
- Growth systems (Analytics, Ads, Tracking)
- AI-powered tools

## What I Do

I design and build end-to-end data and product systems:
from ingestion → transformation → analytics → product integration.

My background is in Data Engineering within marketing and SaaS environments, where I work with large-scale datasets (Search Console, Analytics, Ads) and turn them into actionable products.

I’m especially interested in:
- Data infrastructure
- AI + SaaS
- Product-driven engineering
- Automation at scale
